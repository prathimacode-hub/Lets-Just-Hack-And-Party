## INSPIRATION🌸✨👌

We wanted to help out the beginners and thus we came up with this idea to help them by providing curated starter code for a wide variety of projects so that they can enthusiastically participate in hackathons without any hassles.

## PROJECT LINKS

Github : https://github.com/Fennec2000GH/Lets-Just-Hack-and-Party

Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmM-HybqPsM

Webpage Domain : https://www.letshackandpartycozweloveto.study/

Thanks to MLH and GoDaddy Registry for providing a domain name that suits our project aptly.

## WHAT IT DOES👨‍💻✔📜

This hack is a one stop solution to get into before hacking. We have incorporated starter kits for newbies to look up, the featured projects to sparkle your hack, the blogs one can refer to and most importantly the voice assistant so that it could assist in clearing out all the hacky queries instantly.

## HOW IT'S BUILT🔧🔨🧰

We built the front end using HTML, CSS and Javascript and worked on the backend majorly using Python. Integrated the backend codes with front end templates to provide well versed start up kits. We had added javascripts for dynamic websites and added templates and styling to make the environment user friendly. At last binded them together to make it this hack efficient

## CHALLENGES FACED💀🏃‍♂️

### Getting hold of the backend
We had a tough time getting the backend work done and sorted ngl but WE DIT IT!
### Integrating both front end and backend
Merging the source files and javascript codes appropriately to call the function and showing up in the front end was daunting but gained a happy ending finally.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆

We are proud of the final project we built. We learned a lot while working on the project not just technically but also the time management. Though it was not easy to hack this weekend with team members working with huge time zone differences, we are proud we could complete the project and deliver a beautiful fully functional Hack this weekend.
### Hosting using custom domain
For the first time we decided to go with a very quirky domain name (we wish to win this time) from GoDaddy and it was very interesting because we learnt a lot as it our team member's first time hosting it so yeah we're really happy and proud we decided to go with a challenging task this time.

## WHAT WE HAD LEARNT🧠

### Backend🙇‍♂️💻
We learned a lot in terms of backend and got our skills tested for real this time while we had a hard time getting the backend and front end integrated together. 
### Time Management⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things all together. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing out our work and focusing on multitasking.  Extremely excited for all the learnings we had got through this hack.
### Hosting👩‍🏫👩‍💻
We learned how to claim a custom domain from GoDaddy and make the hosting work out.

## WHAT'S NEXT FOR LET'S JUST HACK AND PARTY⏭⏭⏭

### Future of this Project💡
Next step of this project would be to add up more starter kits, provide various featured projects to deploy in their own hacks which would help them add up their productivity better, showing up the blog categories to choose from based on frameworks, tools, programming languages and many more.
